In developing Crypt::OpenPGP I have received help (either direct or
indirect) from the following individuals, who I would like to thank:

* Vipul Ved Prakash, from whose Convert::ASCII::Armour I borrowed
some regexen for unarmouring data, and who has helped out enormously
with testing against various PGP releases, sending patches, etc.

* Developers of CPAN modules everywhere. Or at least, the modules
upon which I'm relying. :) A list:

Ilya Zakharevich - Math::Pari
Gisle Aas - MIME::Base64, Digest::MD5, Digest::SHA1
Dave Paris - Crypt::DES, Crypt::IDEA (Systemics), Crypt::Blowfish
Abhijit Menon-Sen - Crypt::Twofish
Rafael R. Sevilla - Crypt::Rijndael
Christian H. Geuer-Pollman - Crypt::RIPEMD160
Vipul Ved Prakash - Crypt::RSA
Paul Marquess - Compress::Zlib
Bob Mathews - Crypt::CAST5_PP

* Gary Howland's original pure-Perl PGP code (part of Cryptix) was
useful when I was planning the structure of the code, in
implementing the CRC24 algorithm, and for the basis of the (now
reworked) CFB code.
